Together, we tried to solve the problem. People like that need someone to help them with even the menial things. (1) What if they can control the wheelchair and move independently? (2) What if they can do most of the daily tasks themselves? We successfully solved problem 1. Problem 2 is still a problem for us to solve.</details>
