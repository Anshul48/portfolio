## Projects
_Source code for the projects will be added soon_
**Wheelchair: Won ₹50,000 at JH-SIC competition conducted by IIT Dhanbad**
- In collaboration with Mayank Kumar. I utilised a gaze tracker that tracks the motion of eye ball and moves the wheelchair accordingly. Opencv along with pretained haar cascades were used (application of machine learning). Optimisation and testing was done by me.

<br>There are people whose entire body below the neck is paralysed. How can people like these go on leading normal lives? That's the problem Mayank initially contemplated. Togther, we tried to solve the problem. People like that are bound to wheelchairs, but they need someone to help them with even the menial of things. (1) What if they can control the wheelchair and move on their own? (2) What if they can slowly do most od the daily tasks by themselves? We succesfully solved problem 1. Problem 2 is still a field for us to conquer.
